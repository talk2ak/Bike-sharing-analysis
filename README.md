# Data Analyst Python Projects

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Python project! Projects here are designed to provide you with a comprehensive toolkit for performing EDA on your datasets using Python.

Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step in any data analysis or machine learning project. It helps you understand the structure, relationships, and patterns within your dataset. This project aims to simplify the EDA process by providing a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that guide you through various techniques and visualizations.

Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing: Use the provided functions and techniques to handle missing data, outliers, and other data quality issues.
Descriptive statistics: Calculate and visualize summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.
Data visualization: Explore your dataset visually through histograms, scatter plots, box plots, correlation matrices, and more.
Data distribution analysis: Examine the distribution of your variables, detect skewness, and transform variables if needed.
Outlier detection: Identify outliers using statistical methods and visualize them for further investigation.
Interactive notebooks: Work with interactive Jupyter notebooks that allow you to experiment, visualize, and document your analysis.
